        <h1>On niched product design</h1>
        <h2>Last updated at 5 Mar 2021</h2>
        <p>I came to realize that the most inspiring, innovative, and authentic design on the internet today is coming from the most niched places – or how I call them, niched products.</p>

<p>As a designer, I used to look at the big tech corporations of today (Spotify, Facebook, etc.) for getting inspiration. Everything from a feature to a UI component. As product design in the tech industry has become more standardized and boring, I find it crucial to avoid these same patterns.</p>

<p>It’s only natural that sustainable businesses that pursue profit over growth would be the best places to look for examples. Such companies enjoy the freedom to talk in a unique language to their users – design bold and different interfaces, go wild with ideas, and making the opposite from current trends. The fact that niched products are focused on niched markets is also a huge factor, allowing products to stay loyal to their roots.</p>

<p>Examples for nich-products can found at: <a href="are.na">Are.na</a>, <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>, <a href="notion.so">Notion</a>, <a href="https://museapp.com/">Muse</a>, <a href="Futureland.tv">Futureland</a>, <a href="https://kinopio.club/">Kinopio</a></p>

<p>Having a clear and strong brand character allows such products to break through current familiar conventions and establish new ones.</p>

<p>I’ve found that growth is probably the biggest reason that forces design to be so limited:</p>

<p><strong>The lowest common denominator</strong> - as companies grow, their products have to talk in a wider language, meaning serving more people. Design for a large variety of age groups for example requires a lot more product considerations which in the end, results in more simple, plain, and boring design solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Growth pains</strong> - as companies grow, they move from a fan-only position to amass adoption position. During this transition, the brand/product character tends to change appropriately. The will to satisfy everyone eventually harms the core of the product you built. That’s what I see as a primary reason for product design to be so banal today.</p>

<p>As designers and product builders, we can slowly make this space special again – by saying ‘No’ to the practices we all know today and by forcing ourselves to not just think creatively but rather invent new ones, we can bring backs some of the enthusiasm we need.</p>
