I came to realize that the most inspiring, innovative, and authentic design on the internet today is coming from the most niched places.

Over the years, I used to mainly observe the big corps of our days as role models. Whether I had to design a simple UI element, a new website or just needed an inspiration boost, I've always ended up going back to the same familiar and crowded places.

However, during the last year, I've started to witness more and more products that are taking a different direction, which I like to think of as 'niched product design'. I see these products as:

- Opinionated by design
- Being developed by a small team
- Dedicated to a very specific audience AKA niche
- Speaks a unique design language (e.g bold design, microcopy, unusual interfaces, etc.)


## On culture

I've already shared [some thoughts](https://twitter.com/itaydre/status/1290694840859136000?s=20) about the current state of the design community.

The tremendous acceleration of technology over the past decade have shaped the product design discipline, and not only by creating new role titles. This once small niche has turned into an integral part of almost every business in tech. Folks are more aware of the importance of design, the demand for more designers is growing and generally, design has become popular among other roles in the tech scene.

However, once a culture becomes mature enough, it starts to develop its own bad habits. In some ways our culture got started to get cracked from the inside.

Like [Andy](https://twitter.com/asallen) wrote on his great article:

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="No%20more%20boring%20apps" data-author="@vanschneider" cite="https://vanschneider.com/blog/no-more-boring-apps/">
The world of apps – once an exciting canvas for creative exploration – has become repetitive, predictable and… boring.

And it's now just [websites](https://twitter.com/ow/status/1280251460232581123?s=20) and apps that looks the same. The same goes for [patterns](https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-dribbblisation-of-design/) and [practices](https://twitter.com/tsantsai/status/1430945840785461249?s=20).

This has led me to believe that avoiding the same patterns that have led us to this point is essential. Let's rethink how we approach our craft again.

Going back to the roots might create new opportunities and excitement in our beloved community. It's time to begin a new chapter.


## On characteristic

Despite the phenomena I've just described is ever growing, I've started to notice some new seeds that have being planted. Perhaps it's just my own perspective on the startup world that has changed, but looking at startups in a more humble and realistically eyes suddenly makes a lot more sense for me now.

I think that it only feels natural that businesses that pursue the right ethics would be the ones to cherish and empower design. Chasing over authenticity instead of growth at all cost enables such companies a rare type of freedom.

It's the freedom to be able to develop your own unique language – being different and weird. It's about trying to think in other ways, redefine creativity and pursuing new inventions.

Having a clear and strong brand character allows niched products to break through current familiar conventions while establishing new ones.

The fact that niched products are more focused and defined allows them to stay loyal to their roots. Not wanting to expand to new areas keeps the product core pure.

Existing conventions aren't taboo, but in an era where all apps and websites looks the same, I think that it's crucial to to avoid what we've already eroded. I think that's where innovation starts.

When product makers embrace this mentality, they're removing themselves out from the equation. They're suddenly out of the maniac race of competition, growth, and all of the other startup deep trouble we all know.

These conditions lead to new a new opportunity. Different interfaces, new interactions and experimenting with wild ideas. All but not following the current trends.

## Growth pains

I've found that growth is probably the biggest force that limits design. And while growth is the holy grail in the startup world, it has paradoxically became its Achilles heel, in terms of design.

Similar to the media industry, in order to reach a higher volume of audience (AKA rating), TV shows are deliberately made simple and shallow, so they can appeal to the lowest common denominator.

In my view, this is the reality of product design today. Products must speak a plain language in order to serve more and more audiences. That means using more boring solutions, plain copy, using less creativity, etc.

As companies grow, they gradually move from a state of 'fan-only' to a state of a product for everyone. During this transition, the identity of a product tends to change accordingly. The will to satisfy everyone eventually harms the core of the product you built, and then the magic slowly fades away.


## The desire to change

We can slowly make this space special again. We are the community. What we're making out of design is what we get.

To myself, to other designers, to our discipline, to this young and ever-shifting industry, in defiance to standardization of the design process, in defense of design as a humanly art and craft, I urge you to design with courage, as a human, with idiosyncrasies. It is also your responsibility to educate and influence people around you. Tell them, or even better, show them the difference between a good design and a great one.

It might be the principles we set and the practices we use. It's not enough to just think creatively. It's about how we execute our ideas. Because inventing the wheel isn't a bad word.
