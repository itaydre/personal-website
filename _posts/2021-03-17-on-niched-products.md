I've come to realize that the most inspiring, innovative, and authentic design on the internet today is coming from the most niched places. 

Over the years, I used to mainly observe the big corps of our days as role models. Whether I had to design a simple UI element, a website or perhaps I just needed an inspiration boost – I've always ended up going back to the same old and familiar places.

Popular products of giants we all know are not only dominating the entire web. They stand as a dogma in the field of product design, and have largely swept the community after the same aesthetics and trends probably since forever.

As a designer, I've always wanted to be different. I guess it's a self nature to be original at what you craft, but to be honest, I've been following the herd for quite some time myself.

Recently, I've started to witness more and more products that lean into a different design direction, which I like to think of as 'niche product design'. These products are usually:

- Opinionated by design
- Being developed by individuals or a small team
- Dedicated to a very specific audience AKA niche


## On culture

I've already [shared some thoughts](https://twitter.com/itaydre/status/1290694840859136000?s=20) about the current state of the product design community.

The tremendous acceleration of technology over the past decade have shaped the product design discipline, and not only by creating new role titles. This once small community has rapidly turned into an integral part of the entire tech scene. The awareness for the importance of design has increased, the demand for designers is ever-growing, and generally, design has become popular among other more traditional fields.

However, once a culture becomes mature enough, it starts to develop its own bad habits.

Although [similar voices](https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-dribbblisation-of-design/) have started to appear a few years ago, the truth is that not much has changed since then.

Designers are still chasing after the [same trends](https://twitter.com/ow/status/1280251460232581123?s=20) and even portfolios became [too predictable](https://twitter.com/tsantsai/status/1430945840785461249?s=20).

I guess that this nature of standardization is inevitable not only in our field, but it led me to believe that something have to change. As a start, I think that avoiding the same patterns that have led us to this point is essential.

As written by [Pavel Kedich](https://2019.kedzich.com/) :

> I claim that the other web is the principal source for future development of web design.

I strongly believe that designers should take more unconventional and creative approaches.

To me, going back to the roots means exploring the surface again.

## On characteristic

Despite the phenomena I've just described is ever growing, I've started to notice some new seeds that have being planted. Perhaps it's just my own perspective on the startup world that has substantially shifted, but looking at startups in a more humble and realistically eyes have gotten me to discover the calmer world in tech: bootstrapped startups and indie products.

It seems like businesses that pursue authenticity instead of growth at all costs are naturally more in a position that enables a rare type of freedom. It's a freedom that lets, or even enforces niche products makers to run away from all corny design trends and patterns.

It would be a shame for me to claim that established startups and corporates don't invest or aspire for exceptional design, but when every decision is also a financial one, it's harder to take risks.

When product makers embrace the so-called indie mentality, they're removing themselves out from the equation. They're suddenly out of the maniac race of competition, growth, and all of the other startup deep troubles we all know.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">if ur still thinking in terms of feature comparisons, ur locked in the competition mindset... we playing a different game than the others</p>&mdash; Rainbow (@rainbowdotme) <a href="https://twitter.com/rainbowdotme/status/1437867222685388806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

These conditions unlock new opportunities for designers to break through familiar conventions while establishing new ones — all but not following the status quo.

## Growth pains

I've found that growth is probably the biggest force that limits design. And while growth is the holy grail in the startup world, it has paradoxically became its design Achilles heel.

Similar to the media industry, in order to reach a higher volume of audience (AKA rating), TV shows are deliberately made simple and shallow, so they can appeal to the lowest common denominator.

In my view, this is the reality of product design today.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">it&#39;s really odd that &quot;scaling&quot; something usually means &quot;turning a small good thing into a completely different big thing&quot; instead of &quot;increasing the sheer quantity of those small good things&quot;</p>&mdash; Molly Mielke (@mollyfmielke) <a href="https://twitter.com/mollyfmielke/status/1485033040287961088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As companies grow, they gradually move from a state of 'fan-only' to a state of a product for everyone. During this transition, the identity of a product tends to change accordingly. The will to satisfy everyone eventually harms the core of the product that has been built in the first place, and then the magic slowly fades away.

I highly recommend diving into these references:

- [A Note on Smallness](https://verygoods.co/smallness) - We lost our soul and growth was slow and I failed to raise a Series A investment round and Ebay.
- [Small Giants](https://museapp.com/podcast/24-small-giants/) - A “small giant” is a company that chooses to optimize for mojo instead of growth

## The desire to change

It takes time to a culture to mature.

It took years of grinding, hustling and experiments to get to where we are today, and I think it's time to rethink how we want to march our community. 

I wish more designers and product makers would take, embrace and develop new ways to craft. As [Chuánqí Sun](https://chuanqisun.com/) puts it:

> "To myself, to other designers, to our discipline, to this young and ever-shifting industry, in defiance to standardization of the design process, in defense of design as a humanly art and craft, I urge you to design with courage, as a human, with idiosyncrasies. It is also your responsibility to educate and influence people around you. Tell them, or even better, show them the difference between a good design and a great one."<br>
> [The vanishing designer](https://uxdesign.cc/the-vanishing-designer-6d3d999f9540)

There could be endless ways we can implement such attitude. From principles to practices to aesthetics – it's all come together at the end.

One model that I also noticed characterizes niche products is the model of building in public. Makers being super transparent about the way the build:

- Futureland used to host [live design Fridays](https://futureland.tv/pirijan/futureland-design) where [Pirijan](https://twitter.com/pketh) of [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/) was sharing his designs for a few hours and get feedback.

- Jonnie Hallman, the maker of Cushion is writing a [comprehensive blog](https://cushionapp.com/blog) where he details all about the behind his scenes.

- Alan, the maker of Good News has opened sourced with this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/K0tkNl1y8M9DzHCZn3BcoH/%F0%9F%92%9C-Good-News?node-id=3%3A705).

## Where to look

Luckily, the web is still a magnificent place for exploring and discovering new stuff. Here is a list of my favorite niche-products:

- [Are.na](are.na) - A tool for visually collecting and organizing bookmarks
- [Notion](notion.so) - A tool for creating databases on steroids
- [Muse](https://museapp.com/) - A visual thinking tool in the form of an iPad app
- [Futureland](Futureland.tv) - A tool/social network for documenting and sharing personal/collective journals
- [Kinopio](https://kinopio.club/) - A tool for visually connecting thoughts and ideas
- [Hey](https://www.hey.com/index.html) - A new take on email
- [Readymag](https://readymag.com/) - A no-code tool for making artisan websites
- [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) - A mobile Etheruem wallet
- [Honk](https://honk.me/) - A new take on real-time messaging
- [Cushion](https://cushionapp.com/) - A project management tool for freelancers
- [Good News](https://news.hifolks.com/) - The new DesignerNews, built by the same maker

I'm curious to hear what's your niche!
