            <div class="post-inner-content">
                    <p>I've come to realize that the most inspiring, innovative, and authentic design on the internet today is coming from the most niched places.</p>
<p>Over the years, I used to mainly observe the big corps of our days as role models. Whether I had to design a simple UI element, a website or perhaps I just needed an inspiration boost – I've always ended up going back to the same old and familiar places.</p>
<p>Popular products of tech giants as we all know are not only dominates the entire web on every aspect, but they stand as a dogma in the field of product design, and have largely swept the community after the same aesthetics and trends probably since forever.</p>
<p>As a designer, I've always wanted to be different. I guess it's a self nature to be original at you own personal craft, but if to be honest, I've been following the herd for quite some time myself.</p>
<p>Recently, I've started to witness more and more products that lean into a different direction, which I like to think of as 'niche product design'. These products are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opinionated by design</li>
<li>Being developed by individuals or a small team</li>
<li>Dedicated to a very specific audience – AKA niche</li>
</ul>
<h2>On community culture</h2>
<p>In the past I've <a href="https://twitter.com/itaydre/status/1290694840859136000?s=20">shared some thoughts</a> about the current state of the product design community.</p>
<p>The tremendous acceleration of technology over the past decade have shaped the product design discipline, and not only by creating new role titles. This once small community has rapidly turned into an integral part of the entire tech industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>The awareness for the importance of design has increased</li>
<li>Demand for designers is ever-growing</li>
<li>Design has become popular among other more traditional fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, once a culture becomes mature enough, it starts to develop its own bad habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The world of apps – once an exciting canvas for creative exploration – has become repetitive, predictable and… boring.&quot;<br>
<a href="https://vanschneider.com/blog/no-more-boring-apps/">No more boring apps</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-dribbblisation-of-design/">similar voices</a> have started to appear long ago, the truth is that not much has changed since then.</p>
<p>Designers are still chasing after the <a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1280251460232581123?s=20">same trends</a> and even portfolios became <a href="https://twitter.com/tsantsai/status/1430945840785461249?s=20">too predictable</a>.</p>
<p>I guess standardization is inevitable probably in every field, but this progression has led me to believe that something have to change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I claim that the other web is the principal source for future development of web design.
<a href="https://2019.kedzich.com/">Pavel Kedich, other web</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we avoid transforming into a corporation?</p>
<p>If a culture that becomes too mature is like a startup turns into a corporate, then it might be the time to shake the boat again.</p>
<hr>
<h2>On characteristic</h2>
<p>Despite the phenomena I've just described is ever growing, I've started to notice some new seeds that have being planted.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's just my perspective on the startup world that has substantially shifted throughout the years, but looking at startups with more humble and realistic eyes has gotten me to discover the calmer world in tech: bootstrapped startups and indie products.</p>
<p>It seems like businesses that pursue authenticity instead of growth at all costs are naturally more in a position that enables a rare type of freedom. It's a freedom that lets or even enforces product makers to run away from all corny design trends and patterns.</p>
<p>It would be a shame for me to claim that established startups or corporates don't invest in or aspire for exceptional design, but when every decision is also a financial one, it's harder to take risks.</p>
<p>When product makers embrace the so-called indie or bootstrapped mentality, they're removing themselves out from the equation. They're suddenly out of the maniac race of competition, growth, and all of the other startup deep troubles we all know.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">if ur still thinking in terms of feature comparisons, ur locked in the competition mindset... we playing a different game than the others</p>&mdash; Rainbow (@rainbowdotme) <a href="https://twitter.com/rainbowdotme/status/1437867222685388806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Of course it's not all sunshine and roses. You may skip the exhausting part of taking VC money and you probably also going to have less opinions to hear but getting into a &quot;comfortable&quot; place of self sustaining business is hard.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I think that taking the unfamiliar, less glamorous or shiny approach is more sustainable and not less rewarding than &quot;normal&quot; startups by any means.</p>
<hr>
<h2>These conditions unlock new opportunities to break through familiar conventions while establishing new ones — all but not following the status quo.</h2>
<h2>Growth pains</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A “small giant” is a company that chooses to optimize for mojo instead of growth.&quot;
<a href="https://museapp.com/podcast/24-small-giants/">Metamuse Episode 24 - Small Giants</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've found that growth is probably the most significant force that limits design at any startup that pursues scale. And while growth is the holy grail in this world, it has paradoxically became an Achilles heel in design.</p>
<p>There's one analogy that really makes sense for me when observing that fact: similar to the media industry, in order to reach a higher volume of audience (AKA rating), TV shows are deliberately made simple and shallow, so they can appeal to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p><strong>In my view, this is the reality of product design today.</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">it&#39;s really odd that &quot;scaling&quot; something usually means &quot;turning a small good thing into a completely different big thing&quot; instead of &quot;increasing the sheer quantity of those small good things&quot;</p>&mdash; Molly Mielke (@mollyfmielke) <a href="https://twitter.com/mollyfmielke/status/1485033040287961088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>As companies grow, they gradually move from a state of 'fan-only' to a state of a product for everyone. During this transition, the identity of a product is subject to dramatic change, and in most situations, this is the case.</p>
<p>The will to satisfy everyone and increase revenues eventually harms the core of the product that has been built in the first place, and then the magic slowly fades away.</p>
<p>I think this one sentence from the short retrospective from <a href="http://pieratt.com/">Ben</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/24/ebay-svpply-to-shut-down/">Svpply</a> summarizes it precisely well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We lost our soul and growth was slow and I failed to raise a Series A investment round and Ebay.&quot;
<a href="https://verygoods.co/smallness">A Note on Smallness</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The desire to change</h2>
<p>It takes time to a culture to mature.</p>
<p>It took years of grinding, hustling and experiments to get to where we are today, but it feels to me that it's time to pause for a moment and tinker on how do we want to march our community.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://chuanqisun.com/">Chuánqí Sun</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;To myself, to other designers, to our discipline, to this young and ever-shifting industry, in defiance to standardization of the design process, in defense of design as a humanly art and craft, I urge you to design with courage, as a human, with idiosyncrasies. It is also your responsibility to educate and influence people around you. Tell them, or even better, show them the difference between a good design and a great one.&quot;<br>
<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-vanishing-designer-6d3d999f9540">The vanishing designer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There could be endless ways we can implement such an attitude. From principles to practices to aesthetics – it all comes together in the end.</p>
<p>I find the following practices to be worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Futureland used to host <a href="https://futureland.tv/pirijan/futureland-design">live design Fridays</a> where <a href="https://twitter.com/pketh">Pirijan</a> of <a href="https://kinopio.club/">Kinopio</a> was sharing his WIP design work for a few hours and get feedback from the community members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jonnie Hallman, the maker of <a href="https://cushionapp.com/">Cushion</a> writes a <a href="https://cushionapp.com/blog">comprehensive blog</a> where he details all about the behind his scenes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alan, the maker of <a href="https://news.hifolks.com/">Good News</a> has opened sourced his <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/K0tkNl1y8M9DzHCZn3BcoH/%F0%9F%92%9C-Good-News?node-id=3%3A705">Figma file</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Where to look</h2>
<p>Luckily, the web is still a magnificent place for exploring and discovering new stuff.
I try to maintain a small repo of niche-design products I like here:</p>
